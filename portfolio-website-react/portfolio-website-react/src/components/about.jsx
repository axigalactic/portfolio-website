            I'm an aspiring full-stack developer with a bit of a unique path. I originally graduated with degrees in
            English and Real Estate Management from reputable schools, but my interest in technology has grown, leading
            me to pursue a career in development. My goal is to combine creativity with tech skills to bring fresh ideas
            to the table and collaborate on exciting projects.

            Outside of work, I keep busy with hobbies like gardening, photography, and content creation. I'm also really
            into sportsâ€”running, cycling, swimming, and dragon boat paddling keep me moving. Plus, I'm a big-time animal
            lover, taking care of my two dogs and several adopted cats. If you're looking to collaborate on something
            meaningful or just want to connect, I'd love to chat!
